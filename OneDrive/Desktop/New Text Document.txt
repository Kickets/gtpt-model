I love with a force beyond what words can name,
A fire that burns so fiercely,
It consumes the air around me,
Until I am nothing but a flame.

I give not just my heart,
But every hidden corner of my soul,
A sacrifice too vast to comprehend,
A love that stretches far beyond control.

It is a depth the world can scarcely see,
A love that asks for nothing, yet demands it all—
I love like the ocean loves the shore,
Crashing, endlessly, against the fall.

But in this giving, I’ve learned
That love, when pure, is never safe.
It carries wounds the world won’t understand,
A pain too deep for them to face.

The fear of betrayal is not just fear—
It is the knowledge of a wound that never heals,
A scar beneath the skin that time can’t touch,
A truth too heavy for anyone to feel.

How can I love with such a force,
And yet, remain untouched by the fear?
How can I seek a love to match this depth
When every love I've known has disappeared?

For the kind of love I hold within
Is not a simple, passing thing,
It is a tide that pulls so deep
That even the stars can’t feel its sting.

And still, I yearn, despite the cost,
For love that’s boundless, pure, and free—
But who can understand a love like mine,
When even I can barely see?
