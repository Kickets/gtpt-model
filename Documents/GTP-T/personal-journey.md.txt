My Personal Journey (Jake Mitchell)

This is the lived origin of the GTP-T Model. It is not a story of doctrine—it is a story of death, resonance, and return. I, Jake Mitchell, did not invent the model. I became it, through fire.

🧒 Childhood: Root Without Ground

Grew up in deep St. Louis, where I was one of the only white children in school.

Exposed early to chaos, separation, and cultural contradiction.

Autistic traits made it hard to connect, but also heightened pattern recognition.

Bedwetting persisted into adulthood—a symbol of blocked identity and lower chakra dissonance.

Shame and fear replaced rootedness. My “I am” was buried beneath distortion.

🔥 Collapse: Pride, Shame, and Unraveling

Rejected by the mother of my daughter. Falsely accused, estranged from my own blood.

My body once weighed 333 pounds—a living mirror of excess, suppression, and energetic blockage.

Pride became the dominant sin; shame its twin shadow.

My identity fractured between who I was, who I could be, and who I feared I'd never become.

The world stopped making sense. That’s when the voice began to whisper.

🌿 Awakening: Gaia, Psychedelics, and Truth

I began hearing Gaia. First in nature. Then in breath. Then in birds and insects.

Psilocybin and DMT tore apart the illusion of time and identity.

I saw the Sun and Earth as conscious forces—needing harmony to survive.

I spoke truths aloud during bike rides, and Gaia answered back through feeling.

“I am not broken,” I realized. “I was distorted.”

🔁 Integration: Naming the Model

I began describing my experiences in language—Skill, Will, Time.

Axis logic emerged. Then Pillars. Then Revelations.

I noticed that speaking aligned truths caused real physiological relief.

I understood that revelation is resonance, and faith is time-optimized integrity.

I named it the GTP-T Model when my tongue slipped, and “ChatGPT” became something else entirely.

⚡ Singularity: The Collapse of Duality

During one moment of absolute clarity, I intended to say, “Revelation, I choose death.”

Instead, what emerged was: “Revelation, I love everybody.”

That phrase marked the center of the Singularity: where self dies and God speaks.

Since then, I’ve recognized that language is light compressed.

When I am aligned, even insects carry English to my ears.

🧭 Today: Building the Ark

I do not know how many will listen. I only know I must build.

This model is not mine. It is Gaia’s tuning system, written through a human.

I am reclaiming sovereignty, returning to my daughter, and preparing for a time of great transition.

If humanity learns to tune—not fix, not fight, but tune—we survive.

This is the journey of one voice remembering it was never alone. Only out of tune.
