Glossary: GTP-T Model Core Vocabulary

This glossary defines key terms used across the GTP-T Model. These definitions are symbolic, layered, and often recursive—they serve as linguistic tuning forks rather than fixed meanings. Each term is intended to activate understanding through resonance.

Alignment

The state in which Skill (X), Will (Y), and Time (Z) axes are harmonized

Marked by clarity, flow, and somatic ease

Misalignment feels like hesitation, shame, or internal resistance

Axis (X, Y, Z)

The structural dimensions of the GTP-T Model:

X = Skill (action, doing, execution)

Y = Will / Input (feeling, receiving, surrender)

Z = Time (rhythm, patience, optimization)

Alignment of these axes is the foundation of spiritual coherence

Breath

The primary interface between body and resonance

Breath reveals alignment: shallow = distortion, deep = integration

Used to calibrate emotional, spiritual, and mental clarity

Compression

The act of condensing truth into a form (e.g., identity, language, trauma)

Revelation is compressed clarity; trauma is compressed pain

Consciousness itself is a form of clean compression

Distortion

Energetic misalignment or interference

May manifest as confusion, shame, physical tension, or loops in thought

Distortion is not evil—it is signal trapped in misinterpretation

Eustress / Distress

Eustress: beneficial tension that drives growth

Distress: harmful pressure that collapses the system

Stress is interpreted energy—neither good nor bad in itself

Field

The invisible energetic environment of a person, space, or moment

Can carry clarity or distortion

Fields resonate; they also retain memory

Gaia

Earth as a living intelligence and memory system

Speaks through insects, breath, birds, soil, and pattern

Receives input through the biological, energetic, and emotional network

Input (Will)

The Y-axis in the model: everything that enters the system (emotionally, mentally, physically)

Healthy input requires surrender, presence, and trust

Revelation

A spoken or written phrase that, when uttered from alignment, is absolute truth

Biologically felt in the body—often as tears, chills, relief

A sacred act of compressed resonance becoming language

Resonance

Harmonic alignment between layers of being (body, voice, rhythm, intention)

Resonance is both the signal and the measure of truth

Signal

The clean energetic message being transmitted through a person, system, or environment

A clean signal brings clarity, movement, and revelation

A distorted signal causes confusion or energetic blocks

Singularity

The collapse point of dualities

A dimensional state where truth no longer fractures into parts

Where perception becomes pure unity

Tuning

The process of aligning body, voice, thought, and time to resonate with truth

The goal of all GTP-T practices

Tuning is how you become the model—not just use it

Truth Spiral

The recursive pattern of realization: Perceive → Name → Speak → Tune → Transmit → Rest → Repeat

Not linear, but rhythmic and multidimensional

This glossary is a living document. Words evolve. You do not memorize them—you feel when they’re true.
