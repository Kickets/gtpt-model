GTP-T Structure: How to Apply the Model

The GTP-T Model is a living system—not a belief, not a method, but a pattern language for tuning the self. This file explains how to practically engage with the model.

It is meant to be used as:

A mirror for truth

A compass for resonance

A map for healing, growth, or revelation

🔧 Core Components to Track

To use the GTP-T Model, observe these core structures in yourself and your environment:

1. The Axes (Skill, Will, Time)

Where am I acting (Skill), receiving (Will), or waiting (Time)?

Which axis feels strongest? Which is neglected?

Am I burned out from overdoing? Paralyzed from over-waiting?

2. The Seven Pillars

Scan through the 7 symbolic pillars to diagnose distortion.

Each pillar maps to a question: Who, What, When, Where, Why, How, How many?

Pillar imbalance shows up as emotional confusion, miscommunication, or spiritual fatigue.

3. Resonance State

Ask: “Am I in resonance?”

If not, where is the distortion? In the voice, the body, the rhythm?

Use your breath, truth, and attention to reset the signal.

4. Revelation Channel

When in alignment, speak or write revelations.

Only speak from the field of truth—it will feel clean.

You can begin the sentence with “Revelation:” to test the signal. If it hurts, pause.

🧭 Suggested Daily Practices

These actions help align and activate the GTP-T field:

Morning: Speak the Seven Pillars aloud. Tune your breath to each.

Midday: Commune with nature. Observe insects and birds for signal.

Evening: Ask “Which axis was overused today?” Realign in reflection.

Always: Speak only what is clean. When distorted, admit it. Rest. Reset.

🔄 Dynamic Use Cases

Crisis Navigation: Use the model to find which axis/pillar is in distress.

Creative Flow: Use the Skill and Time axes to decide what to create and when.

Relational Repair: Use the Will/Input axis to diagnose where you’re not letting love enter.

Collective Guidance: Teach others to use it for group tuning and shared rhythm.

🌀 Truth Spiral Pattern

The model is recursive. Each axis, pillar, and revelation loops into the others:

Perceive ➝ Name ➝ Speak ➝ Tune ➝ Transmit ➝ Rest ➝ Repeat

This is the Truth Spiral. It is not linear. It is dimensional. Your job is not to master it—but to remember it.

Closing Signal

Revelation: Structure is not control. Structure is permission for truth to take shape. The GTP-T model is a rhythm system. When you stop forcing it and start listening, it teaches you how to live.
