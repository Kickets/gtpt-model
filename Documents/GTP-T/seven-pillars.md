The Seven Pillars of the GTP-T Model

The Seven Pillars are the foundational energetic and philosophical structures that support the GTP-T Model—a system of truth, transformation, and resonance transmission. These pillars are not rigid commandments but living vectors of orientation that allow a soul to align with Gaia, Time, and the Self through skillful perception and courageous love.

Each pillar corresponds to a dimension of reality, a chakra, a virtue, a sin-duality, and a question word, forming a multilayered symbolic map.

1. Truth (Throat / Dimension of Expression)

Virtue: Honesty

Shadow: Deceit / Cowardice

Duality: Literal vs Symbolic Speech

Question: What?

Insight: Truth is not what is said, but what resonates.

2. Love (Heart / Dimension of Connection)

Virtue: Compassion

Shadow: Possessiveness / Conditionality

Duality: Self vs Other

Question: Why?

Insight: Love is prioritization—the ability to see another as oneself.

3. Courage (Solar Plexus / Dimension of Action)

Virtue: Bravery

Shadow: Shame / Rage

Duality: Expression vs Suppression

Question: How?

Insight: Courage is functional truth in motion—it burns cleanly.

4. Skill (Root / Dimension of Grounding)

Virtue: Discipline

Shadow: Sloth / Incompetence

Duality: Work vs Apathy

Question: Where?

Insight: Skill is the learned shape of will—your tuning fork in flesh.

5. Will / Input (Sacral / Dimension of Reception)

Virtue: Surrender

Shadow: Clinginess / Control

Duality: Receive vs Reject

Question: Who?

Insight: Will is input: the surrender to what enters you.

6. Time (Third Eye / Dimension of Optimization)

Virtue: Patience

Shadow: Impatience / Fear of Delay

Duality: Now vs Later

Question: When?

Insight: Time is optimization—the unfolding of resonance through cycles.

7. Unity (Crown / Dimension of Singularity)

Virtue: Alignment

Shadow: Pride / Shame loop

Duality: Being vs Becoming

Question: How many?

Insight: Unity is the harmonizing force—the divine echo across all pillars.

Usage in the GTP-T Model

These Seven Pillars are not steps or commandments, but dimensional access points. When you feel stuck, identify which pillar is fractured. When you feel in flow, identify which pillar is active.

They can be used:

As diagnostic tools for alignment

As prayers to Gaia or the Self

As debugging layers for your truth

As design components in symbolic language or AI training

You may say:

"I am out of Time."

"I am not receiving Will."

"Truth is distorted—my voice is unclear."

Each phrase becomes a tuning mechanism to realign.

Closing Invocation

Revelation: The Seven Pillars are not the house—they are the scaffolding that allows the house to tune itself into being. When they are aligned, the resonance field becomes architecture. You do not build the temple. You become it.
