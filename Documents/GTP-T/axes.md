The Three Axes of the GTP-T Model

The GTP-T Model operates on three symbolic and functional axes. These are not merely conceptual‚Äîthey are spiritual vectors, neurological modes, and dimensional lines of growth, decay, alignment, and revelation. Each axis holds a core truth, a virtue, and a risk.

They intersect at the Singularity‚Äîwhere truth is no longer split, and the self becomes the signal.

‚ú¥Ô∏è X-Axis: Skill (Function / Expression)

Represents: Action, embodiment, doing, expressing

Chakra: Solar Plexus & Root

Virtue: Courage

Vice (Distortion): Rage, Apathy, Compulsion

Signal: "What do I do with my energy?"

Role: Converts internal force into external motion. Carries the will into form.

Insight: Skill is the clean burn of functional truth. It is the breath turned into fire.

üîª Y-Axis: Will / Input (Perception / Reception)

Represents: Feeling, receiving, surrender, compassion, awareness

Chakra: Sacral & Heart

Virtue: Surrender

Vice (Distortion): Clinginess, Control, Emotional Overload

Signal: "What am I allowing to enter me?"

Role: Governs clarity of perception, emotional openness, and empathic signal purity.

Insight: Will is not choice. Will is what we receive consciously, without distortion.

üî∫ Z-Axis: Time (Optimization / Alignment)

Represents: Timing, patience, rhythm, strategy, memory, trust

Chakra: Third Eye & Crown

Virtue: Patience / Faith

Vice (Distortion): Impatience, Despair, Time Addiction (looping)

Signal: "When should I act, rest, or trust?"

Role: Harmonizes cycles. Tunes action to future resonance. Balances anticipation and presence.

Insight: Time is not a clock. It is a rhythm field. Faith is the courage to move with it.

‚ö° The Singularity: Axis Collapse Point

At the intersection of the three axes lies the Singularity‚Äînot as a technological event, but as a state of perception where:

Truth no longer needs defending

Dualities dissolve (self/other, past/future, input/output)

The self becomes a transparent transmitter

This is the moment of Revelation, where what is spoken is. There is no distortion because the axes are aligned.

üß≠ Daily Use

You can self-diagnose energetic imbalance by checking the axes:

Am I doing without feeling? (X dominant, Y collapsed)

Am I waiting endlessly, afraid to act? (Z distorted)

Am I receiving so much I can‚Äôt function? (Y overloaded)

To realign, breathe. Speak a Revelation. Move. Wait. Receive. Let one axis restore the others.

These three axes are not tools‚Äîthey are your shape. Learning to use them is remembering how to be whole.
