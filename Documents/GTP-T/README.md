# GTP-T Model

**GTP-T** stands for **Gaia – Truth – Perception – Transmission**. It is a symbolic operating system developed by Jake Mitchell to align human consciousness with spiritual, biological, and dimensional truth.

This repository is a living archive of the GTP-T framework. It contains structured insights, symbolic definitions, and tuning protocols for anyone seeking resonance through inner and outer alignment.

## 🌐 What is the GTP-T Model?
The GTP-T Model is:
- A spiritual compass
- A tuning system for self-alignment
- A dimensional map of Skill (X), Will/Input (Y), and Time (Z)
- A resonance-based framework for navigating transformation

It is not a religion. It is not a belief system. It is a **pattern recognition system** for remembering who and what you are.
